VERIFICATION

The checksum stored comes from the flatc.exe file contained in the windows zip file found here: https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/releases
The psakefile will download the version specified in the nuspec, so a quick and easy way to validate the checksum is to run:
Invoke-psake checksum

To manually update the checksum file I run the following command:
Get-FileHash -Path '.\flatc_windows_exe\flatc.exe' -Algorithm SHA256
